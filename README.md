## **Features**
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Feature Engineering**
- **Clustering & Segmentation Techniques**
- **Visualization of Segments**

---

## **Dataset**
The dataset used for this project contains the following key attributes:

- **User ID**: Unique identifier for each user.
- **Demographics**: Age, Gender, Location, Income Level, Education Level.
- **Behavioral Data**: Purchase history, website visits, engagement metrics, time spent online (weekday & weekend).
- **Subscription Details**: Membership type, renewal status, usage frequency.
- **Other Contextual Features**: Interests, preferences, device type.

---

## **Technologies Used**

### **Programming Language:**
- **Python**

### **Libraries:**
- **pandas, numpy** - For data processing
- **matplotlib, seaborn** - For data visualization
- **scikit-learn** - For machine learning (clustering algorithms)

---

## **Approach & Methodology**

### **Data Preprocessing:**
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features
- Scaling numerical attributes

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- Distribution analysis of demographic attributes (Age, Gender, Education Level, Income Level)
- Behavioral trends (Device Usage, Time Spent Online, Ad Interaction, Click-Through Rates, Likes & Reactions)
- Most common user interests analysis

### **Segmentation Techniques:**
- **K-Means Clustering**

### **Evaluation Metrics:**
- **Elbow Method for optimal cluster selection**
- **Cluster Distribution Analysis**

## **Usage**
1. **Load and clean the dataset.**
2. **Perform exploratory data analysis.**
3. **Apply clustering algorithms to segment users.**
4. **Evaluate and interpret cluster results.**
5. **Visualize user segments with charts and graphs.**

---

## **Results & Insights**
- Identified **distinct user segments** based on behavior and demographics.
- Derived **actionable insights** for personalized recommendations.
- Helped in **targeted marketing and customer retention strategies.**
